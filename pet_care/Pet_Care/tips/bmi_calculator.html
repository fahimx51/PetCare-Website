        <h2>How to Assess Body Condition Score</h2>
        <p>
          The Body Condition Score is typically rated on a scale from 1 to 9,
          with 1 being underweight, 5 being ideal, and 9 being overweight.
          Here's a general guide for assessing BCS:
        </p>

        <h3>For Dogs:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Underweight (1-3):</strong> Ribs, spine, and pelvic bones
            are easily visible. No palpable fat, and an obvious waist and
            abdominal tuck.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ideal/Normal (4-5):</strong> Ribs are easily felt but not
            visible. A visible waist and abdominal tuck.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overweight (6-9):</strong> Ribs are difficult to feel, and
            there's noticeable fat covering them. The waist is less defined, and
            there may be a sagging abdominal area.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Cats:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Underweight (1-3):</strong> Ribs, spine, and pelvic bones
            are easily visible. No palpable fat, and an obvious waist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ideal/Normal (4-5):</strong> Ribs are easily felt but not
            visible. A visible waist and abdominal tuck.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overweight (6-9):</strong> Ribs are difficult to feel, and
