        <h2>What Nutrients are Essential for My Pet?</h2>
        <p>
          While you may have heard us say “pets need nutrients, not
          ingredients,” what exactly are those essential nutrients? Here’s a
          breakdown of all the essential nutrients according to the Association
          of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) that are required for foods
          to be called complete and balanced for adult and growing cats and
          dogs. Included are also links to other blog posts that describe some
          of these nutrients and why they’re essential.

          <b>Protein and Amino Acids:</b><br />

          While the amount may differ between dogs and cats, and between adults
          and seniors, all pets have a minimum requirement for protein to make
          muscle in the body and help in many important body functions. Amino
          acids are the building blocks of protein and there are approximately a
          dozen essential amino acids in addition to a minimum of overall
          protein that all pets need:
          <br /><br />
          <ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Arginine</li>
            <li>Histidine</li>
            <li>Isoleucine</li>
            <li>Leucine</li>
            <li>Lysine</li>
            <li>Methionine</li>
            <li>Cystine</li>
            <li>Phenylalanine</li>
            <li>Threonine</li>
            <li>Tryptophan</li>
            <li>Valine</li>
            <li>Taurine (cats)</li>
        </ol>

          <b>Fats and Fatty Acids</b><br />

          All pets have a minimum amount of total fat that they need in their
          diet and there are also some specific types of fatty acids that are
          also required for different lifestages. Overall fats and specific
          types of fatty acids help your pet maintain a healthy skin/coat,
          regulate inflammation, and aid in development in growing pets.

            <li>Linoleic Acid</li>
            <li>Arachidonic Acid (cats)</li>
            <li>Alpha-Linoleic Acid (growth)</li>
            <li>EPA + DHA (growth)</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>

          <b>Minerals</b><br />

          Minerals, some of which are also called electrolytes, are critical to
          keeping fluid balance, growing and maintaining bones, and helping to
          regulate many processes running in a pet’s body, such as movement of
          muscles. The amounts required can vary between growing and adult
          animals, and there is also a required ratio of certain minerals such
          as calcium and phosphorus for optimal health, especially for growing
          large breed puppies.

          <b>Vitamins</b><br />

          Cats and dogs require many of the same vitamins as we do (except for
          Vitamin C, which they can make themselves!), but the amounts can be
          very different. One example is Vitamin D, where dogs need less than
          1/10th the amount that humans do, so we have to be very careful about
          using human products (or any supplements for that matter!) in pets to
          avoid toxic amounts of vitamin D. Vitamins perform many functions in
          the body from supporting the immune system to breaking down food for
          energy, and are either water soluble (the B vitamins) or fat soluble
          (vitamins A, D, E and K). The essential vitamins for dogs and cats are
          listed below with common alternate names that you may see on your pet
          food ingredient lists.
          <br />
          Vitamin A (retinol), Vitamin D (cholecalciferol), Vitamin E
          (tocopherol), Vitamin K (phylloguinone, cats), Thiamine (Vitamin B1),
          Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Niacin (Vitamin B3), Pantothenic Acid
          (Vitamin B5), Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6), Folic Acid/Folate (Vitamin B9),
          Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin), Choline,<br /><br />

          <b>Where Can I Go To Learn More?</b><br />

          If you’d like to learn more about the exact amounts required of these
          nutrients in different lifestages and species, booklets are also
          available online from the National Resource Council with more details
          on each of these essential nutrients for dogs and cats. How Do I Know
          My Pet Is Getting All These Nutrients? Foods that have AAFCO
          nutritional adequacy statements that state they are complete and
          balanced have to include all these essential nutrients and stay
          between the minimum requirements and any maximums. Providing extra
          through supplements may actually harm your pet because you may
          unknowingly be providing a toxic amount of some nutrients that have
          narrow safety ranges! We recommend only giving supplements with any of
          these essential nutrients when recommended specifically by your
          veterinarian.
